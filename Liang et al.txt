                                        insights crucial to a myriad of real-world applications. Recent
                                        advancements in Foundation Models (FMs) have fundamentally
                                        reshaped the paradigm of model design for time series analysis,
                                        boosting various downstream tasks in practice. These innovative
                                        approaches often leverage pre-trained or fine-tuned FMs to harness
                                        generalized knowledge tailored specifically for time series analysis.
                                        In this survey, we aim to furnish a comprehensive and up-to-date
